# exchange-app-ios

This is an exchange application created with SwiftUI. It has a main application *ExchangeApp* and 7 Swift packages;

 - Common
 - CurrencyBaseAPI
 - FixerAPI
 - LocalCache
 - DesignSystem
 - Welcome
 - Currencies

You can find the detailed documentations for each component in the respective folders. For the application documentation you would need to look at *Exchange/Exchange/README.md*. For the packages documentation you would need to look at *Packages/{Name}/README.md* file.

Thank you :)
